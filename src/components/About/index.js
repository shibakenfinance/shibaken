          SHIBAKEN was inspired from MEME Token of his *Grandpa-Scandals* DOGE and NOW ready to entertain 100 Quadrillion human population who keen to pet SHIBAKEN.

          Remember where most of MEME tokens come up with low supply that might not be enough to be pet by human, We only created 100 Quadrillion SHIBAKEN to fit market size of the human race. Every single person in the world, deserve to have an equal 12.7 Millions SHIBAKEN to feel fulfillment of petting.

          During release on the Uniswap, we gonna added 35% SHIBAKEN for liquidity to the markets and left 5% population for ShopKeeper. The rest 60% SHIBAKEN are goes with their lovely OWNER! Any SHIBAKEN Owners that sold their dogs into markets, 1% will get burned and 1% for Reward holders.

          With that being said, I hope you all have a wonderful day, and start to own SHIBAKEN as your PET.
